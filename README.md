# ev3-beep-door
Basic server to create an API for the Beep door opener, and serve a web interface for testing it. 

## Potential Features
* Door open/close status
  * Tracking if the door is open or closed would be interesting, but requires some more work to add global state to the Flask server
* Authentication
* Proper API documentation 
   * WIP :)
